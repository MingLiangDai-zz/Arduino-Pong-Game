# Arduino-Pong-Game
**Description:**
This is an Arduino project that simulates the classic game, Pong, using the potentiometer and the 8 by 8 LED display board. The potentiometer is used as a controller to move the playboard and the ball is able to bounce off the edge of the LED display as well as the playboard. The goal of this game is to keep the ball in the playing field for as long as possible. This becomes gradually harder as the speed of the ball increases over time.
